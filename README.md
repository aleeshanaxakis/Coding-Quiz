# Coding-Quiz

## Description
I developed a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote from scratch.

This project taught me a lot about Web APIs.

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Installation
The timed coding quiz can be accessed via the URL: https://aleeshanaxakis.github.io/Coding-Quiz/

## Usage
Employers may use coding quizzes as part of the interview process when hiring web developers. Alternatively, students learning to code may use coding quizzes to practice their skills and put them to the test.
